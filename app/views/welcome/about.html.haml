  There are plenty of good analytic services, but that doesn't mean you can't build a better one. Your analytics service will offer a few key features:
%ul
  %li A client-side JavaScript snippet that allows a user to track events on their website.
  %li A server-side API that captures and saves those events to a database.
  %li A Rails application that displays the captured event data for a user.
